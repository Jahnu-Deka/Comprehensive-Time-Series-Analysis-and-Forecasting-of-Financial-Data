# Comprehensive-Time-Series-Analysis-and-Forecasting-of-Financial-Data

This project presents a meticulous time series analysis and forecasting of stock prices, utilizing a variety of statistical techniques and machine learning models. The core objective was to delve into historical stock price data, identify hidden patterns, and develop robust models to accurately forecast future stock prices. The dataset, encompassing five years of daily stock prices for multiple companies, served as a comprehensive foundation for our time series analysis.

We commenced with a thorough data preparation and exploratory data analysis phase. This involved cleaning and preprocessing the historical price data to ensure its suitability for in-depth analysis. By identifying the top 10 most traded stocks based on average trade volume, we narrowed our focus to the most significant and representative data. This step also included a detailed descriptive analysis of each stock's price movements and trade volumes, providing valuable insights into their historical performance.

Our analysis leveraged advanced techniques such as time series decomposition, auto-correlation, and partial auto-correlation to uncover underlying trends, seasonality, and residuals. We employed the Dickey-Fuller test to assess the stationarity of the time series data. Subsequently, we developed and validated forecasting models using Auto-ARIMA and the Prophet model, showcasing the practical application of these models in predicting future stock prices. The analysis illuminated distinct patterns and trends within the stock market, offering valuable predictions and insights for investors and analysts alike. This project stands as a testament to the power of time series analysis in making informed financial predictions and decisions.
